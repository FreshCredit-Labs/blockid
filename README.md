# Substrate Cumulus Parachain for BlockID®

1. What is the BlockID® dNFT?

The BlockID® dNFT is, "Data Management Protocol - DMP", the user’s interface allowing individuals and organizations to interact with and leverage their data. By connecting to the network, users gain instant access to a cryptocurrency wallet, allowing them to leverage the BlockIQ® DAO to control and monetize their most valuable asset, data. When users generate a new cryptocurrency wallet, they create a non-transferable unique dNFT (dynamic NFT) called a BlockID® dNFT. Using the BlockID® dNFT, the user decides which permission-based data the network can use to improve the scoring algorithms. As data is continually added to the network, the individual generates more tokens that serve as receipts for the provided data.

This is the secure global financial identity allowing lenders to provide compliant lending options to consumers and businesses without exposing the personal or sensitive data of the user. The BlockID® NFT is a dNFT (dynamic NFT) that can be updated and altered over time alongside the network and be used to self-collateralize loans. A BlockID® dNFT is the credit reporting registry protocol tracking current and historical debt obligations tied to the user’s BlockID® dNFT.

The user’s BlockID® is the key and access point for the user to control and customize data sharing options that give the individual the ability to interact with their BlockID® and the data ledger, storing hashed versions of all the data captured on the network. This allows them to customize the amount and type of data they allow for analysis when they would like to monetize their data utilizing the network. User-specific data earnings are calculated and fractionalized from the total earnings generated on the monetization layer and stored on the earnings ledger before being distributed to each individual’s BlockID® dNFT wallet.
